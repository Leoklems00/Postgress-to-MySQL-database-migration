    "\n",
    "This project was inspired by need. I had this database in postgress but wanted to provide it to someone who was working on a mysql database. I initially just shared the exported file from postgressql but it failed to work for the person and the reasons are obvious but i was ignorant of it at that moment. I started wondering and trying many things that faild, including searching for and trying tools online, then trying to use my python skills and all but i was learning with it some of the things i did not know before. I kept meeting challanges and overcoming, my result was becoming close to perfect untill the last challange was \"howto pass read and pass a null value from posgressql to mysql database using raw sql in python\". I nearly gave up until i remembered that i can work with dataframes, from then it was only a mater of minuitesfor me to have my result ready and with very little stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see some of the things i did while navigating and learning many things, they are in the other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the steps i took to solve the problem finally(in summary)"
