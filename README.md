# <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0px;"> About the Project
This project was inspired by need. I had this database in postgress but wanted to provide it to someone who was working on a mysql database. I initially just shared the exported file from postgressql but it failed to work for the person and the reasons are obvious but i was ignorant of it at that time. I started wondering and trying many things that faild, including searching for and trying tools online, then trying to use my python skills and all but i was learning with it some of the things i did not know before. I kept meeting challanges and overcoming, my result was becoming close to perfect untill the last challange was "howto pass read and pass a null value from posgressql to mysql database using raw sql in python". 
I nearly gave up until i remembered that i can work with dataframes, from then it was only a mater of minuitesfor me to have my result ready and with very little stress.

You can see the main work in the "Data Migration from postgress db to mysql db" file and some of the other things i did while navigating and learning many things, they are in the other files[postgress-mysql and Rough postgress-mysql].

### <p align="center">Objective :
The objective of this project is to migrate a data from PostgresSQL database to MySQ database.

## <p align="center">Some of the lessons learnt

1. The different flavors of SQL have their diffent ways of going about structure.
2. PostgresSQL is more broad in the datatypes it accept more than MySQL.
3. The best way to habdle the migration is to pass throgh dataframes.
4. No shortcut to the process only look for and learn better tools.
